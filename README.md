A week ago, I started to learn the C programming language. I was looking for some good practices and projects since I was already familiar with C++. I asked ChatGPT to suggest some good projects with emphasis on memory management, and ChatGPT suggested several projects with different levels, as you can see here:[suggested C proojects](https://chatgpt.com/share/68b39ee5-7280-800f-9f07-d99a4f5d1902))
I try very hard to use ChatGPT as little as possible for code generation because the whole purpose of these projects is education and learning. But I will continue to use ChatGPT as a mentor. I will provide all my chats with GPT regarding this project and later on for all these project series.
